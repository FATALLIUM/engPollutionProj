    <h1>Health risks of PM2.5</h1>
    <div class="quoteContainer">
        <p>
            Concerning respiratory diseases, exposure to PM has been shown to cause several diseases and health effects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pulmonary fibrosis:</li>
            <p> - Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that causes the lungs to become scarred and stiff, thus making it
                difficult to breathe.</p>
            <li>Increase in M1 and M2 macrophages:</li>
            <p> - Both of which are white blood cells that fight microorganisms and remove dead cells in the body. The
                increased count of M2 macrophages can cause both pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer.</p>
            <li>Cardiovascular effects:</li>
            <p> - PM2.5 is linked to a higher risk of heart attack, hypertension, and stroke, atherosclerosis (plaque
                buildup in arteries), and lead to other heart problems, including arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms).
            </p>
            <li>Other diseases:</li>
            <p> - PM2.5 is also related to endocrine diseases, obesity and diabetes, and neurological diseases. As one
                can tell, there are a myriad of health issues that air pollution can cause.</p>
        </ul>
