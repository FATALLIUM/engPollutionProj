    New York City Department of Health, Environment & Health Data Portal. Health impacts of air pollution data. Asthma emergency department visits due to PM2.5. Accessed at <a href = "https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/health-impacts-of-air-pollution/?id=2108" target = "_blank">Link</a>. on 11/07/2024</p>

    <p>“Traffic and PM2.5 Air Pollution.” Environment & Health Data Portal, <a href = "a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/traffic-and-air-pollution/" target="_blank">Link</a>. <br>
    This article explores the relationship between traffic emissions and PM2.5 air pollution, focusing on the health effects of fine particulate matter on the body. It highlights how air pollution, specifically from traffic, is particularly harmful in poverty-stricken neighborhoods, where PM2.5 levels are highest. The article provides various visual aids, including a 2D pie chart, graphs, and a table, which are helpful for understanding the data related to PM2.5 exposure and its health consequences. While the article offers valuable data and insights, its credibility is somewhat compromised by broken links to two of its cited sources. Data from this article can easily be incorporated into the essay, most notably the pie chart. Noting the health impacts such as cardiovascular hospitalizations could be incorporated in how air pollution impacts the body. Though, the parts about traffic emissions can also be used to relate traffic emissions to air pollution.</p>

    <p>Asthma and Lung UK. “Air Pollution and Your Lungs | Asthma + Lung UK.” Www.asthmaandlung.org.uk, 28 Feb. 2023, <a href="//www.asthmaandlung.org.uk/living-with/air-pollution/your-lungs" target="_blank">Link</a>. <br>
    This is an informational page that explains what air pollution is, the types of air pollution (e.g. sulfur dioxide, ozone), and the effects they have on the human body. The explanations in the page are concise and cover a broad range of topics, but lack in-depth detail. The page does not provide any references or sources to support its claims. Additionally, there is no visual data, such as graphs or tables, to help illustrate the data presented, which could have been helpful in understanding. Considering that the page is by a reputable organization from the UK, the information can be used in the essay paper. It would be useful to explain the different types of air pollution, particularly PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. These three types of air pollution can be connected to the EPA’s article on the respiratory effects from air pollution.</p>

    “Particle Pollution and Respiratory Effects” is an informational page explaining what particle pollution is and the respiratory effects it concerns. The page explains the respiratory effects of acute and chronic exposure to air pollution, as well as its role in lung cancer incidence and mortality. The information in this page has references to studies, paragraphs are descriptive, and the links function as they should. However, the page does not have any visual data. While that may be the case, visual data is not needed in order for this source to be implemented into the essay, but it would have been helpful visualization for readers. The EPA is a government agency, so this page can be used as a reputable source. The information on this page will be the main source used to explain the effects of air pollution to the human body. It will be noted that there is evidence of a relationship between fine particles and lung cancer incidence and mortality.</p>
