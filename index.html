            In dense urban cities like New York, air pollution is bound to be an issue. With traffic congestion, packed concrete buildings, and industrial waste, pollutants contaminate the city air.</p>
        <p>Prolonged exposure to fine particle pollutants can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (also known as COPD), asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, and respiratory infections (US EPA).</p>
        <p>The health risks of PM2.5 in NYC can be reduced by using cleaner technologies like electric vehicles and renewable energy, along with stricter pollution rules and enforcement. Extra focus should also be given to vulnerable groups, such as low-income communities, who are most affected by air pollution.</p>

    <h1>What is PM2.5?</h1>

        <p>
        Firstly, what is air pollution? It is anything that makes the air more toxic and harmful to our lungs. There are multiple types of air pollution, with some examples listed prior.</p>
        <p>Particulate matter (PM) is the most dangerous of them. They are airborne combustion particles or other organic compounds ranging from 10 micrometers to less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. PM pollutants can be chemically composed of metallic, inorganic compounds, and elemental carbon. Larger particles– PM10– such as dust or soot can be large enough to be stuck in the nose. The size of PM2.5, however, allows it to fit inside the bloodstream and breathing sacs in the lungs. Both PM2.5 and ultrafine particles (PM0.1), each being 2.5 and less than .1 micrometer in length respectively– can fit into red blood cells.</p>

        <p>The dangers of PM are due to its miniscule size, and because it can be inhaled, it can irritate airways which may reduce lung function.</p>
