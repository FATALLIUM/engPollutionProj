        <p>Neighborhoods like East Harlem, Union Square, and East Village in NYC have high levels of air pollution,
            particularly from PM pollutants (“Exposure to Polluted Air”).</p>

        <p>East Harlem Demographics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>30% Black</li>
            <li>46% Hispanic</li>
            <li>Poverty rate of 38% (“East Harlem Neighborhood Profile”)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Areas like East Harlem and East Village are considered Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhoods, which mainly
            consist of people of color or lowincome residents.</p>

        <p>High-poverty neighborhoods had 4.5 times more asthma-related emergency visits due to PM2.5 than low-poverty
            areas (Kheirbek et al).</p>

            <li>Emergency visits due to PM2.5:</li>
            <p>The number of adult emergency department visits due to PM2.5 per year (per 100, 000) in East Harlem is
                111.6 compared to the citywide 34.6.</p>
            <p>The number of child emergency department visits for the neighborhood and citywide is 215.5 and 78.2
                respectively. EJ neighborhoods have almost 3 times the citywide average rate.</p>
            <li>Exposure to emissions: </li>
            <p>Almost all of these EJ neighborhoods are exposed to emissions from heavyduty vehicles, sources of PM2.5
                and nitrogen oxides. To make matters worse, most neighborhoods with the highest rates of emergency
                department visits due to pollution are located within a mile of major pollution sources, such as power
                plants or industrial facilities (“Exposure to Polluted Air.”).</p>

        <p>It can easily be inferred how socioeconomic status and geographic
            distribution affect vulnerable populations such as the impoverished and the colored.
