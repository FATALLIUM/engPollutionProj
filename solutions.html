        <p>Reducing PM2.5 emissions requires dedication and proper enforcement. Ways to do this are shown below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Local Law 97 (Climate Mobilization Act):</li>
                <p> - Passed in April 2019 as part of the NYC Green Deal.</p>
                
                <p> - Aims for net-zero emissions in the city's largest buildings by 2050, with stricter limits by 2030.</p>
                <p> - Buildings are penalized $268 per metric tonne of CO2 over the emission limit.</p>
                <p> - As buildings reduce fossil fuel use, PM2.5 levels also decrease (Urban Green Council).</p>

                <li>NYS Clean Heat Program:</li>
                <p> - Focuses on transitioning to cleaner energy, such as heat pumps.</p>
                <p> - A study found significant reductions in air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide)
                when buildings switched from #6 oil to cleaner energy.</p>
                <p> - Greater impact observed in lower-income areas (Zhang et al.).</p>

                <li>Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs):</li>
                <p> - Federal Clean Air Act allows NY to adopt California’s ZEV standards, including battery-electric and hydrogen
                fuel-cell vehicles.</p>

                <hr>
                <br>
                <p> - ZEVs produce no engine exhaust and emit no nitrogen oxides or hydrocarbons.</p>
                <p> - Though costly ($24,000-$40,000), ZEVs have lower maintenance costs, saving up to $6,400 over time ("Zero
                Emission Vehicles: Driving towards the Future").</p>
                
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
        <p>By continuing and expanding efforts like Local Law 97, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Heat Program, NYC can
            work towards its emission reduction goals. </p>
